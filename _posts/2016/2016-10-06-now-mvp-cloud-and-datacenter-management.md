I am very proud to announce that I have [received the Microsoft MVP award](/blog/tags/#MVP) for the 7th time. But now I am a [MVP Cloud and Datacenter Management](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4029117?fullName=Nicholas%20%20Dille).<!--more-->

For many years, I have been strongly focussed on end-user computing designing and implementing Citrix XenApp as well as the products related to or required by such environments. With this I seem to have earned the first six awards as MVP Remote Desktop Services / Enterprise Mobility. But over the years my interest started shifting. After nearly twelve years I felt the strong urge to change and focus on topics I started finding more interesting.

When I started as a DevOps Engineer at [Haufe-Lexware](https://www.haufe-lexware.com/), this marked a very drastic change because I will not be working/focusing in end-user computing anymore. By then, my interests had already changed to automation and infrastructure components at the low end of the stack. I had started investing heavily in automation (mainly using [PowerShell](/blog/tags/#PowerShell)), configuration management (mainly using [PowerShell Desired State Configuration](/blog/tags/#PSDSC)) and [containerization](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4029117?fullName=Nicholas%20%20Dille) (Windows based as well as Linux based).

By now, I am working on continuous delivery for infrastructure components including topics like immmutable servers, blue/green deployments and the like. Funnily this also included dusting off my [Linux](/blog/tags/#Linux) skills which have been dormant for many years ... but you never really forget how to use `vim`.

In the end, you will have already noticed that the focus of this blog has changed as well and it will continue to reflect my new focus. I hope you find the content still relevant.
