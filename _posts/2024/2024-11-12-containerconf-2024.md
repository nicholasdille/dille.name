I just attended this year's [ContainerConf](https://www.containerconf.de) in Mannheim. It was awesome meeting old and new friends and talking all things containers. I had the pleasure to contribute a full-day workshop about CI/CD with GitLab as well as a talk about tricks and caveats when using Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC).
