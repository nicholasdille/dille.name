On 10.09.2010 I held a session at [ice:lingen](http://www.ice-lingen.de/) about performance monitoring and capacity management of Windows Servers. Attached you’ll find [my slides](/media/2010/10/ice-2010-Performance-Monitoring-und-Kapazitätsmanagement-public.pdf).

Please note that I had to remove most of the images because I am not allowed to show them publicly.
