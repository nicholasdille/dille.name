I am very proud to announce that I have been named Microsoft [Most Valued Professional (MVP)](http://www.microsoft.com/mvp) for Remote Desktop Services (RDS). It is amazing to see that it is recognized how much passion I invest in the community through this blog and by giving talks.

Thanks a lot, Microsoft. I'll make the most of it!
