In 2009, Ruben Spruijt ([@rspruijt]https://twitter.com/rspruijt)) and Jeroen van de Kamp ([@thejeroen(https://twitter.com/thejeroen)) started [Project Virtual Reality Check](http://www.projectvrc.com/) (Project VRC). Since then, they have published numerous, valuable whitepapers with performance results and best practices with regard to different hypervisors, application virtualization solutions, Windows operating systems, antivirus solutions and Microsoft Office versions.<!--more-->

Since 2013 they are publishing an annual survey about VDI and SBC environments called "State of the VDI and SBC union". The results are available with all the other [whitepapers by Project VRC](http://www.projectvrc.com/white-papers) and provide valuable insights into the usage of desktop virtualization around the world.

This year, the survey will be repeated to see how the industry has changed over the last year. And again, they need your help to produce the same results as previously. Mind that the success of the survey is determined by the number of partitipants and the quality of the responses. As a treat, only the participants will receive an exclusive overview report shortly after the survey closes on February 15th 2015.

Please [head over to the survey](http://www.projectvrc.com/blog/23-project-vrc-state-of-the-vdi-and-sbc-union-2015-survey) and make sure you support this important project with only 10-15 minutes of your time. I am already done :-)
