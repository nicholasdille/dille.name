Today I talked about #Azure #RemoteApp at #DuCuG in Amsterdam. I'd like to share my slide deck and the code for one of my demos.

The DuCUG community events are well-known throughout Europe as the Dutch are a very active folk in the Microsoft and Citrix ecosystem. That is why I felt honoured to be asked to hold a presentation at this meeting.

I covered the following topics with a heavy focus on the infrastructure necessary to run a hybrid deployment including detailed demos about virtual networks, site-2-site VPN and Azure AD Connect.

  * Short introduction to Remote Desktop Services
  * Cloud deployment
  * Hybrid deployment including virtual network and Azure Active Directory Connect with password synchronization
  * Authentication
  * Applications
  * Automation

## Demos

In addition to several live demos of the cloud and hybrid deployments, I have also given a short introduction to managing Azure RemoteApp using PowerShell. The [code of this demo is available at GitHub](https://github.com/nicholasdille/Sessions/tree/master/2015-09-25%20ARA%20%40%20DuCUG%20Amsterdam).
