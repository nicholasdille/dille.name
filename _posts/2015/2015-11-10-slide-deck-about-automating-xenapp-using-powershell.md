Today I talked (in German) about automating #XenApp using #PowerShell at [DCUG](https://www.dcug.de/) in Freiburg. I'd like to share the short slide deck as well as the code for my extensive demos. DCUG is a Citrix User Group event held in German and is organized by [Roy Textor](https://twitter.com/roytextor).

## Slide Deck for Automating #XenApp using #PowerShell

[![First slide of presentation](/media/2015/11/Tastatur-statt-Maus.png)](/media/2015/11/2015-11-05-XA-PS-@-DCUG-Karlsruhe.pdf)

Either click the image above or [this link](/media/2015/11/2015-11-05-XA-PS-@-DCUG-Karlsruhe.pdf) to download the slide deck for automating #XenApp using #PowerShell.

I covered the following topics with a heavy focus on making changes to many servers at the same time with or without throttling:

  * Why Citrix Studio does not help you being faster in your job
  * A short introduction to PowerShell
  * Basic PowerShell cmdlets to get you started
  * Treat your servers as cattle not as pets
  * Extensive introduction to the XenApp PowerShell API
  * Using PowerShell remoting to import cmdlets from a remote machine

## Demos

Although the slides show a lot of examples how to use the XenApp PowerShell API, I have covered even more code in [my demos which are available on GitHub](https://github.com/nicholasdille/Sessions/tree/master/2015-11-05%20XA%20PS%20%40%20DCUG%20Freiburg).
