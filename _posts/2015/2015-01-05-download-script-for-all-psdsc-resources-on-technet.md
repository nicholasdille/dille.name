In the [announcement of wave 9 of the resource kit for PowerShell Desired State Configuration](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2014/12/17/another-holiday-present-from-the-powershell-team-dsc-reskit-wave-9.aspx), the PowerShell team states that improvements will be published to the individual resources instead of waiting for the next wave. This got me thinking whether I really wanted to check the growing number of DSC resource individually. That's why I created a download script to fetch all of them from TechNet.<!--more-->

Although this is more on the dirty side of my solutions, it does the job ;-)
