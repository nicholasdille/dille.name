Last week I talked about #Azure #RemoteApp at #VCNRW, the Virtualization Community NRW in Cologne, Germany. I'd like to share my slide deck and the code for one of my demos.

Although the Virtualization Community NRW (VCNRW) is a rather new community event filling a gap in and near Cologne. It is focussed on topics covering the virtualization technologies by Microsoft, Citrix and VMware.

## Slide Deck for #Azure #RemoteApp at #VCNRW

My session was titled "Ein Arbeitsplatz in der Cloud durch Azure RemoteApp". VCNRW has published [a very benevolent article about me and my session (German)](http://vcnrw.de/referentenportraet-nicholas-dille/)</a>.

Either click the image above or [this link](/media/2015/06/2015-06-18-VCNRW-Azure-RemoteApp.pdf) to download the slide deck for #Azure #RemoteApp at #VCNRW.

I covered the following topics:

  * Short introduction to Remote Desktop Services
  * Cloud deployment
  * Hybrid deployment including virtual network and Azure Active Directory Connect with password synchronization
  * Authentication
  * Applications
  * Automation

## Demos

In addition to several live demos of the cloud and hybrid deployments, I have also given a short introduction to managing Azure RemoteApp using PowerShell. The [code of this demo is available at GitHub](https://github.com/nicholasdille/Sessions/tree/master/2015-06-18%20ARA%20%40%20VCNRW%20K%C3%B6ln).
