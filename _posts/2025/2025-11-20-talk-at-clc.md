I just attended this year's [ContainerConf](https://www.containerconf.de) in Mannheim. It was awesome meeting old and new friends and talking all things containers. I had the pleasure to contribute a full-day [workshop about CI/CD with GitLab](/blog/2025/11/18/workshop-about-gitlab-ci-at-clc/) as well as a talk about shell code.
