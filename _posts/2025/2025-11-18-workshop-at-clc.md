I just attended this year's [CLC Conference](https://www.clc-conference.eu) in Mannheim. It was awesome meeting old and new friends and talking all things containers and automation. I had the pleasure to contribute a full-day workshop about CI/CD with GitLab as well as a [talk about shell code](/blog/2025/11/20/talk-about-shell-code-at-clc/).
