The Linux process scheduler allows custom priorities to be attached to a process to provide some metric to decide whether a process deserves more processor time than others.<!--more-->

* _Nice values_ range from -20 to 19 which represent the highest and lowest priority, respectively. As one would have expected `root` is allowed to set any priority he chooses whereas users will not be able to raise the priority of a process below zero.

* _The command <code class="command">nice</code>_ changes the priority of a process upon invocation: `nice foobar`. By default, the results in a nice value of 10 which effectively lowers the priority of the process by assigning less processor time.

* _The command <code class="command">renice</code>_ adjusts the nice value of a running process, process group or user which results in a change of its priority:

  * Changing the nice value of a process: `renice {+|-}NICE -p PID`

  * Changing the nice value of a user's processes: `renice {+|-}NICE -u USER`
