As I have announced a few weeks ago, this article kicks off a new series about analyzing performance data. The individual articles will discuss different aspects of correctly working with the collected data. They will provide the necessary mathematical and statistical background for processing and visualizing the data.

<!--more-->

Nevertheless, these articles will always focus on performance monitoring and demonstrate how the background knowledge will support you in the analysis of your data.

[Part 1: Averages](/blog/2011/06/27/statistical-analysis-of-performance-data-part-1-averages/ "Statistical Analysis of Performance Data Part 1 – Averages")

[Part 2: Correcting the Dataset](/blog/2011/07/15/statistical-analysis-of-performance-data-part-2-correcting-the-data-set/ "Statistical Analysis of Performance Data Part 2 – Correcting the Data Set")

[Part 3: Histograms](/blog/2011/11/16/statistical-analysis-of-performance-data-part-3-histograms/ "Statistical Analysis of Performance Data Part 3 – Histograms")

Later parts will be about correcting data sets by removing values, histogram and value distribution.
