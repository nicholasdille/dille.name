Although many linux distributions are preconfigured for various locales, they may need further user customization to support the desired features.<!--more-->

1. Generate an US locale with support for German characters:

  `$ localedef -c -i en_US -f ISO-8859-15 en_US.ISO-8859-15`

1. Setup an US locale with support for German characters in the environment

  ```
  export LANG="en_US.ISO-8859-15"
  export LANGUAGE="${LANG}"
  export LC_TYPE="de_DE@euro"
  ```

  (This assumes that the appropriate locale is either installed by default or was manually generated.)

1. Configure XTerm to correctly display the Euro character:

  `$ xterm -font -*-fixed-medium-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-15`

1. Choose an Euro aware font for text consoles:

  `$ setfont lat9w-16`
