[keychain](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Keychain) is a manager for the SSH agent. It ensures that there is a single running SSH agent which can be used from several shells at the same time.<!--more-->

The standard usage of keychain in a bash is demonstrated by the following listing:

```
$ keychain
$ source ~/.keychain/$(uname -n)-sh
```

A similar behaviour has previously been implemented by myself, see [my setup]("My Setup: Public Key Authentication" /blog/2005/01/23/my-setup-public-key-authentication/) and [my setup 2]("My Setup 2: Public Key Authentication" /blog/2007/11/30/my-setup-2-public-key-authentication/).
