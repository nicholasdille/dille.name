The SSH agent stores unencrypted private keys to help you log in to servers without supplying your private key's passphrase during retries.<!--more-->

NOTE: Unfortunately the agent stores private keys for an unlimited amount of time by default. Therefore, please take note of command line parameters of `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` to limit the key lifetime inside the agent.

For `ssh-add` and `ssh` to work the two commands rely on two environment variables: SSH\_AGENT\_PID and SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK. The following two methods will start the SSH agent with automatically setting those environment variables:

1. _Method 1:_

  * Starting the agent:

    bash: `eval $(ssh-agent -s -t LIFETIME)`

    tcsh: `eval $(ssh-agent -c -t LIFETIME)`

    (the key lifetime is specified in seconds)

  * Adding keys to the agent:

    `ssh-add -t LIFETIME KEYFILE`

  * Removing keys from the agent:

    `ssh-add -d KEYFILE`

  * Removing all keys from the agent:

    `ssh-add -D`

  * Stopping the agent:

    bash: `eval $(ssh-agent -s -k)`

    tcsh: `eval $(ssh-agent -c -k)`

2. _Method 2:_

  * _Starting the ssh agent:_

    `ssh-agent -t LIFETIME COMMAND`

  * Adding and removing private keys work as described in method 1 from COMMAND.

  * _Stopping the agent:_ Terminate COMMAND

Example sessions:

1. _With the SSH agent:_

  ```
  $ ssh-agent -t 60 bash --login
  $ ssh-add TEST
  Need passphrase for TEST
  Enter passphrase for TEST:
  Identity added: TEST (TEST)
  $ ssh -i TEST USER@HOST
  Last login: SOMETIME from SOMEWHERE
  ```

  Successive logins are possible.

1. _Without the SSH agent:_

  ```
  $ ssh -i TEST USER@HOST
  Enter passphrase for key 'TEST':
  Last login: SOMETIME from SOMEWHERE
  ```

  The passphrase is needed for each and every login.
