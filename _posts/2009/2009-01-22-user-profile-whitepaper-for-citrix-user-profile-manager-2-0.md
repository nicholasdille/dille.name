I am proud to announce the availability of the user profile whitepaper for Citrix User Profile Manager (UPM) 2.0. It has been a lot of new and updated content to reflect the changes in UPM 2.0 compared to the Tech Preview.

<!--more-->

  * All sections are extended to include information about Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
  * In XenApp 5.0 for Windows Server 2008, Citrix introduced Special Folder Redirection. Its use in managing user profiles is discussed in the context of Folder Redirection.
  * The challenges involved in providing user profiles now include locked profiles and misbehaving applications.
  * The traditional remedies new include UPHClean, commonly used group policies and group policy preferences.
  * The chapter about UPM is updated to describe the features introduced in version 2 and how the challenges involved in managing user profiles are met.
