<p class="note">
  NOTE: This note assumes that you own a SSH login on the machine that hosts the repository.
</p>

Instead of connecting to a pserver CVS can be tunnelled through SSH to protect the versioned data:

<!--more-->

<pre class="listing">CVS_RSH="ssh" cvs -d :ext:USER@HOST:PATH -z9 checkout MODULE</pre>

<p class="note">
  NOTE: Please be aware that not all versions of CVS are interoperable, eg. client version 1.11 and server version 1.11.11 will not work together.
</p>

Unfortunately CVS is not as flexible as RSync (see [RSync over SSH](/blog/2003/09/21/rsync-over-ssh/ "RSync over SSH")) because the content of <code class="command">CVS_RSH</code> must be a single command without any arguments. To work around that restriction you need to create a script that wraps the desired command line arguments:

<pre class="listing">#!/bin/sh

ssh -p 12345 $*</pre>

Instead of using such a wrapper script you can also add an appropriate entry to your [SSH Config](/blog/2004/03/10/client-configuration/ "Client Configuration").
