It has been rather quiet in this blog and on Twitter as well. In fact, I have been working on a related project with three other IT Pros that has consumed a lot of my available time. I can finally break the silence and make the announcement that in Juli, Galileo Press will publishing our (German) [book about Hyper-V and System Center](http://www.galileocomputing.de/katalog/buecher/titel/gp/titelID-3276).

At least two of my co-authors are very well known: [Nils Kaczienski](http://www.faq-o-matic.net/2013/03/27/hyper-v-das-handbuch-ab-juni-2013/) ([MVP Active Directory](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Nils%20Kaczenski-9194)) and [Marc Grote](http://www.it-training-grote.de/blog/?p=5317) ([MVP Forefront](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Marc%20Grote-10416)). And last but not least I am writing with [Jan Kappen](http://www.hyper-v-server.de/author/jan-kappen/) who is working with [Carsten Rachfahl](http://www.rachfahl.de/) (MVP Hyper-V). It has been a fun time and I have learned a lot from those three guys. It is a real pleasure to be working on this project with them.
