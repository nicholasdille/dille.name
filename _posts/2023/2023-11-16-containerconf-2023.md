I recently attended this year's [ContainerConf](https://www.containerconf.de) in Mannheim. I was awesome meeting old and new friends and talking all things containers. I had the pleasure to contribute a full-day workshop about CI/CD with GitLab as well as a talk about using container registries for generic artifacts with and without OCI 1.1 and another one about automatically updating dependencies using Renovate.
