I have updated the crosscompiling hint with the following:

  * corrected the toc and the bin86 heading as i forgot to update the version there after updating bin86 to 0.16.2
  * added AMD Athlon and Duron to the list of processor architectures
  * corrected processor architecture list (AMD K6* is i586)
  * updated lilo to 22.2
  * updated bin86 to 0.16.2
  * simplified kbd 1.06 commands
  * replaced the original uname hack kernel module with an easier to use by Yann Guidon<!--more-->
