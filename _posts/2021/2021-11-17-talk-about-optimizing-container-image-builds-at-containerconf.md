As part of [ContainerConf](https://www.containerconf.de/) I gave a talk about optimizing the build process of container images. This can be achieved in the following dimensions: faster builds, smaller images, more secure contents and easier maintenance.

I covered the following topics:
- Multi-stage builds
- `FROM scratch`
- Order of commands
- BuildKit RUN cache
- Heredocs
- `USER`
- Parallelization in multi-stage builds
- Build automation using CI/CD
- BuildKit remote cache
- Testing container images
- Scanning for vulnerabilities
- Dependency update using RenovateBot
- Auto merging patch updates

The slides are a result of my slide and demo build system. Take a look at the [release for this talk](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/releases/tag/20211117).
