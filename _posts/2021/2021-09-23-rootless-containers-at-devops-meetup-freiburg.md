As soon as in-person meetup events were possible, I gave a talk at [DevOps Meetup Freiburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/DevOps-Freiburg/events/280512257) about rootless containers.

I covered the following topics:

- Design and components of Docker
- Security flaws, e.g. privileged containers
- What rootless containers are
- Rootless Docker
- Nesting rootless containers
- Remoting rootless containers
- Rootless Podman
- Rootless BuildKit
- Rootless containerd
- Rootless Kubernetes

Find my slides [here](https://dille.name/slides/2021-09-23/DevOps-Meetup-Rootless-Containers.html).

The slides are a result of my slide and demo build system. Take a look at the [release for this talk](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/releases/tag/20210923.1).
