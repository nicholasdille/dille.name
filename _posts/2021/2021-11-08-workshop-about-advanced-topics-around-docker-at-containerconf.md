As part of [ContainerConf](https://www.containerconf.de/) I held a workshop covering advanced topics around containerization.

The agenda offered the following topics:
- Images and layers
- Namespaces and control groups
- Nested containers
- Docker remoting
- Multi-platform images
- Remove builders using `buildx`
- Rootless containers
- Heredocs in Dockerfile

Find my slides [here](https://dille.name/slides/2021-11-08/ContainerConf-Advanced-Containers.html#/).

The slides are a result of my slide and demo build system. Take a look at the [release for this talk](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/releases/tag/20211108).
