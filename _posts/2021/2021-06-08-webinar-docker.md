[heise Academy](https://heise-academy.de/) has organized a series of [webinars around containers and Kubernetes](https://webinare.heise.de/kubernetes/). I had the honour to contribute two half-day webinars - one about Docker for beginners and a second one about Kubernetes for beginners. On June 8th, I held the first one with 230 attendees.
