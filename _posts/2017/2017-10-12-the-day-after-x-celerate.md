On 10-10-2017 our very own conference [x-celerate](https://www.x-celerate.de) took place at the trade fair in Freiburg, Germany. With well over 100 attendees, the feedback proved it was a success in its first year.<!--more-->

All of this would not have been possible without [a great team](https://www.x-celerate.de/aboutus). We were very lucky with such a great speaker line-up (in alphabetical order):

- [Michael Bruns](https://twitter.com/der_miggel)
- [Martin Danielsson](https://twitter.com/donmartin76)

- [Manuel Rauber](https://twitter.com/ManuelRauber)

The [trade fair in Freiburg](http://www.messe.freiburg.de) was a superb choice as venue with enough room to accomodate all attendees without getting crowded and extraordinary food. Although my talk was scheduled to the smaller room, it was packed with an audience of roughly 50.
