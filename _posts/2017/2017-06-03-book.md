I am proud to announce that our [third book about Hyper-V](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/microsoft-hyper-v_4229/) is now available. For this new edition we have taken the time to update most of the book with new information about Windows Server 2016. We have also added a new chapter about containerization using Docker.<!--more-->

I'd like to thank my co-authors [Nils Kaczenski](https://twitter.com/Kaczenski), [Jan Kappen](https://twitter.com/JanKappen) and [Marc Grote](http://www.it-training-grote.de/) for the great team work on this edition. It's amazing how little time we had to invest in organizing the work and were able to focus on writing.
