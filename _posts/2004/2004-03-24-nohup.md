The <code class="command">nohup</code> command allows executing programs which are safe from hangup signals:

<!--more-->

<pre class="listing">nohup COMMAND [&]</pre>

The command is not pushed in the background (see [Job Control](/blog/2004/06/07/job-control/ "Job Control") for details). Also, it does not change the niceness of the command (see [Nice](/blog/2003/09/21/nice/ "Nice") for details).

<code class="command">nohup</code> also ensures that any output is captured and redirected to a file. The two files <code class="command">./nohup.out</code> and <code class="command">${HOME}/nohup.out</code> are tried in the presented order and, if possible, is created with <code class="command">0600</code> permissions. If the selected file already exists, it will not be overwritten nor will its permissions be modified but instead the output is appended.

It also ensures that any output is redirected either to <code class="command">./nohup.out</code> or <code class="command">${HOME}/nohup.out</code>. If not present one of these files will be created with <code class="command">600</code> permissions although if the file is present the permissions are not modified.

The exit code of <code class="command">nohup</code>:

  * _126_ <code class="command">COMMAND</code> could not be invoked although it was found

  * _127_ <code class="command">nohup</code> failed (e.g. <code class="command">COMMAND</code> could not be found)

If <code class="command">COMMAND</code> was successfully invoked, the exit code will be that of <code class="command">COMMAND</code>.
