The `nohup` command allows executing programs which are safe from hangup signals:<!--more-->

`nohup COMMAND [&]`

The command is not pushed in the background (see [Job Control](/blog/2004/06/07/job-control/) for details). Also, it does not change the niceness of the command (see [Nice](/blog/2003/09/21/nice/) for details).

`nohup` also ensures that any output is captured and redirected to a file. The two files `./nohup.out` and `${HOME}/nohup.out` are tried in the presented order and, if possible, is created with `0600` permissions. If the selected file already exists, it will not be overwritten nor will its permissions be modified but instead the output is appended.

It also ensures that any output is redirected either to `./nohup.out` or `${HOME}/nohup.out`. If not present one of these files will be created with `600` permissions although if the file is present the permissions are not modified.

The exit code of `nohup`:

* _126_ `COMMAND` could not be invoked although it was found

* _127_ `nohup` failed (e.g. `COMMAND` could not be found)

If `COMMAND` was successfully invoked, the exit code will be that of `COMMAND`.
