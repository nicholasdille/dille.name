Messages that are produced by the kernel are placed in a ring buffer which has a default size of 16392 bytes. This buffer is available from userspace via `/proc/kmsg`. Messages are categorized into levels which are also used to decide which are printed to the console.<!--more-->

Define       | Level | Description
-------------|-------|------------
KERN_EMERG   | -     | System is unusable
KERN_ALERT   | 1     | Action must be taken immediately
KERN_CRIT    | 2     | Critical conditions
KERN_ERR     | 3     | Error conditions
KERN_WARNING | 4     | Warning conditions
KERN_NOTICE  | 5     | Normal but significant condition
KERN_INFO    | 6     | Informational
KERN_DEBUG   | 7     | Debug-level messages

`dmesg` allows printing and controlling the ring buffer:

* _Show content:_ `dmesg`

* _Console verbosity level:_ `dmesg -n LEVEL`

* _Ring buffer size:_ `dmesg -s SIZE`

* _Clear ring buffer:_ `dmesg -c`
