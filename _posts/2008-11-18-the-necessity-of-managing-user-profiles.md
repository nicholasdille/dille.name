I have recently had the chance to write an article for a German journal called [LANline](http://www.lanline.de/). The article focuses on user profile management and why modern approaches of application delivery create the need for a user profile management solution.

The article can be read in the printed issue published in October 2008. Please note that this article is written in German.

I have previously covered this topic extensively in my [whitepaper about user profile management](/blog/tags#user-profile-whitepaper/).

Have fun reading any one or both ;-)
