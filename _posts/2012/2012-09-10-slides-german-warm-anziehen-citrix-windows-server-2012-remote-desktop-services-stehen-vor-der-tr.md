On 08.09.2012 I held a session at the [ice conference in Lingen](http://www.ice-lingen.de/) comparing the new Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2012 with Citrix XenApp. A big thank you to my audience for placing me second - after Nils Kacienski who became Speaker of the Year.

Attached you'll find [my slides](/assets/2012/09/ice-2012-Nicholas-Dille-Windows-Server-2012-RDS.pdf) as well as the [two scripts](/assets/2012/09/ice-2012-Nicholas-Dille-Windows-Server-2012-RDS.zip) I used for demonstrating the new deployment options based on PowerShell v3.

**Update.** My talk was recorded and is [available through TechNet media.](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032532012)
