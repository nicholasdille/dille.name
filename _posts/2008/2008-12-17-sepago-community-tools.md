A couple of hours ago, sepago started the [Community Tools](https://www.sepago.de/freeware) blog as a publishing platform for freely available tools. So far it contains the tools which I and [my colleague Helge Klein](https://helgeklein.com) have published in the past. New tools by other co-workers will be made available there. The first addition is [Profile Nurse](https://www.sepago.com/blog/2008/12/17/profilenurse-profile-maintenance-made-easy) developed by two colleagues. Helge has written a [detailed announcement](https://helgeklein.com/blog/2008/12/enter-profilenurse-your-skilled-profile-care-professional/). Enjoy this site and the future content.
