By now, you have probably read about sepago striking a deal with Citrix (see our [press release as PDF](http://www.sepago.de/sites/default/files/downloads/press_release_sepago_sells_profile_management_to_citrix_05_2008_en.pdf) as well as [Doug's](http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=7807) and [Thomas Kötzing's](http://www.thomaskoetzing.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=278&Itemid=254) article). Our product sepagoPROFILE is now owned by Citrix and [released](http://www.citrix.com/upm) under the name of "User Profile Manager" or, short, UPM. I am really glad to announce that I will be able to maintain the whitepaper about user profile management which I have [published in the last months](/blog/tags#user-profile-whitepaper/).

From the press release:

_Cologne/Houston 20 May 2008. At the Citrix Synergy exhibition in Houston (Texas/USA), Cologne-based sepago GmbH today announced that the sepagoPROFILE software it developed has been sold to Citrix Systems Inc. USA. The agreement includes the complete takeover of the product, which will form the future core technology for profile management within the Citrix Delivery Center (Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix XenApp and Citrix Provisioning Server). In addition, the development division of sepago will continue development of the product for the virtualization of application provisioning in cooperation with Citrix over the next 18 months._

It is now called "Whitepaper - Citrix User Profile Manager" and will be updated in cooperation with Citrix to reflect new features and the integration with Citrix' product portfolio. Please note that the download location has changed. sepago now provides a [landing page for the whitepaper](http://www.sepago.de/citrix/upmwhitepaper.html) where all future versions of the whitepaper will be released as well as a history documenting all changes. On this page you can already find an updated version of the whitepaper (version 1.6) to reflect the change in the name. So, stay tuned for exciting updates of the whitepaper.
