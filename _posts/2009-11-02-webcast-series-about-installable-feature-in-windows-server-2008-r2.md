My colleague Nicki Wruck ([@CommunityGuide](http://twitter.com/CommunityGuide)) has started a huge series of short videos about the features in Windows Server 2008 R2 - in German.

<!--more-->

Windows Server 2008 R2 has more than 80 features available to the administrator to supplement the numerous roles. But many of these features have strange names making them close to impossible to understand.

Nicki has already published 10 videos on a YouTube channel called [R2FeatureTalk](http://www.youtube.com/r2featuretalk). Watch me [talking about Network Load Balancing](https://www.youtube.com/user/R2FeatureTalk#p/u/5/Ym3dardUI0c) - and I will be involved in several more.

Kudos for this great idea, useful content and funny introductions.
