I have updated the crosscompiling hint with the following:

  * removed the uname hack
  * added targetting description for perl
  * added net-tools patch
  * added psmisc optimization
  * added note about packages which are left out
  * added optimization for bin86, lilo, sysvinit
  * added optimization for simpleinit, pam
  * added description of the traditional and the kernel module uname hack
  * added a table of intel architecture names
  * moved non-standard packages to separate chapter

It can be downloaded [here](/assets/2002/02/2002-03-04-crosscompiling-x86-2.1.txt).
