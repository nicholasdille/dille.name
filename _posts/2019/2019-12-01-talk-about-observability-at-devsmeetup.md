Last week I had the chance to [talk about observability](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Devsmeetup-Freiburg/events/vlftklyzpbkc/) at our local [Devsmeetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Devsmeetup-Freiburg/). As usual, after the talk we had a very lively discussion about monitoring in general but also about Prometheus and long term storage.
