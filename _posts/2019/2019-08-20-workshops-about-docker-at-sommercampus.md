I had the honour to contribute two workshops about Docker to an called [Sommercampus](https://sommercampus.fachschaft.tf/) held by the faculty of engineering of the university Freiburg:

1. Docker for Beginners ([slides](/slides/2019-08-02/Sommercampus 2019 - Fundamentals.html))
1. Docker for Advanced Users ([slides](/slides/2019-08-02/Sommercampus 2019 - Advanced.html))

The demos are part of the slides.
