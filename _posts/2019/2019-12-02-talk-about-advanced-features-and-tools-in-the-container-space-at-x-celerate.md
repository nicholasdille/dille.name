For the third time in a row, I co-organized a regional IT conference called [x-celerate](https://www.x-celerate.de) held in Freiburg, Germany. This time, I contributed a talk about covering the following topics:

- Remote build cache using [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
- Build secrets using [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
- Troubleshooting containers
- Vulnerability scans using [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- Container image builds using [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img)
- Lightweight Kubernetes using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
