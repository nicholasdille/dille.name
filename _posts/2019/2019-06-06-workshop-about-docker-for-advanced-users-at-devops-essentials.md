This week, I attended a new kind of conference organized by [dpunkt](https://www.dpunkt.de/), [heise Developer](https://www.heise.de/developer/) and [iX](https://www.heise.de/ix/). They decided to have most half-day workshops with only one keynote-like talk per day. I was able to contribute one of the half-day workshops for advanced users of Docker.<!--more-->

In my workshop I covered the following topics:
- Building from git
- Multi-Stage Builds
- Images, manifests, layers and registries
- Build cache
- Volume management
- Network management
- Docker CLI plugins
- Docker remoting
- Inception (nested containers)
- Security

Please find the slides [here](/slides/2019-06-06/Devps Essentials 2019.html). The demos are part of the [repository hosting the slides](https://github.com/nicholasdille/Sessions/tree/2019-06-06/containers).
