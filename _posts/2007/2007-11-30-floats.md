Floating environments allow you to have [Figures](/blog/2007/11/30/figures/) to be placed automatically in sensible places by LaTeX.<!--more-->

## Standard Figures

This floating environment causes the figure to use the whole width of the page:

```latex
% ...
\begin{document}
% ...
\begin{figure}[PLACEMENT]
% ...
\end{figure}
% ...
\end{document}
```

Placement:

* `h`: here

* `t`: Top

* `b`: Bottom

* `p`: On page containing floats

* `!`: Force

Placing two figures next to each other inside a single figure environment including captions printed below and labels:

```latex
\begin{figure}[t]
\parbox[t]{7cm}{
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=7cm]{figure1}
    \caption{figure 1}
    \label{fig.figure1}
}
\parbox[t]{7cm}{
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=7cm]{figure2}
    \caption{figure 2}
    \label{fig.figure2}
}
\end{figure}
```

## Floating Figures

This floating environment allows text to be printed next to the figure.

```latex
% ...
\usepackage[OPTIONS]{floatflt}
% ...
\begin{document}
% ...
\begin{floatingfigure}[PLACEMENT]{WIDTH}
% ...
\end{floatingfigure}
% ...
\end{document}
```

Options:

* `rflt`: Placed right in paragraph

* `lflt`: Placed left in paragraph

* `vflt`: Placed left on even-numbered pages and right on odd-numbered

Placement:

* `r`: See above

* `l`: See above

* `p`: See above

* `v`: See the vflt package option

NOTE: Using this package, floating figures need to placed with care: They may disappear if placed too close to sectioning commands. They may overlap with list environments.

Referring to figures is referring to captions: See [Caption](/blog/2007/11/30/captions/)

Stopping a floating environment to be moved to the end of the document:

```latex
% places all floats and starts a new page
\clearpage

% places all floats and starts a new double page
\cleardoublepage
```
