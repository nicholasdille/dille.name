List environments like `itemize` can be customized.

## Itemize with small item spacing:

```latex
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item ITEM1
\item ITEM2
\end{itemize}
```

## All available lengths

Length     | Description
-----------|------------
\topsep    | Vertival space before and after list environment
\itemsep   | Vertical space between lines
\parsep    | Vertical space between paragraphs inside an item
\partopsep | Vertical space before list environment if it starts a new paragraph

NOTE: You will not be able to modify `topsep` and `partopsep` inside a list environment because the space was already added at that point.

NOTE: The default values of these lengths depend on the depth of the list environment.

See [Dense Lists](/blog/2007/11/30/dense-lists/) for an example how to modify `topsep` and `partopsep`
