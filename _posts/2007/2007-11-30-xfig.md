XFig is an drawing program which stores images in its own format (fig) which can be converted to most commonly used image and vector formats:<!--more-->

## XFig and LaTeX

Start XFig to design figures for use in LaTeX:

```
xfig
    -nosplash
    -metric
    -paper_size a5
    -portrait
    -zoom 2.25
    -latexfonts
    -exportLanguage eps
```

The standard LaTeX page layout (read about changing the page [Margins](/blog/2007/11/30/page-margins/)) leaves the author approximately with the width of an a5 page for his content.

## XFree Resources

Expressing the above command using [XFree Resources](/blog/2003/09/21/xfree-resources/):

```
Fig.splash: false
Fig.inches: false
Fig.paper_size: A5
Fig.landscape: false
Fig.zoom: 2.25
Fig.latexfonts: true
Fig.exportLanguage: eps
```

## Conversion

Converting fig files:

```
fig2dev -L {eps|jpeg|latexpdf|png|tiff} [infile [outfile]]
```

Example:

```latex
% file based
fig2dev -L eps <file>.fig <file>.eps

% stream based
cat <file>.fig | fig2dev -L eps > <file>.eps
```
