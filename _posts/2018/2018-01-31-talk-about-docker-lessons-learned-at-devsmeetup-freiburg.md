At the end of January 2018 I had the opportunity to talk at [DevsMeetup Freiburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Devsmeetup-Freiburg/) about the [lessons I learned working with Docker](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Devsmeetup-Freiburg/events/vlftklyxcbpc/).<!--more-->

I was very fortunate to have a very interactive crowd. Thanks for having me and for the controversial discussions.

Here are [my slides](https://github.com/nicholasdille/Sessions/tree/master/2018-01-31%20Docker%20%40%20Devsmeetup).
