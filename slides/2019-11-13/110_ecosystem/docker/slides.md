## Relevance of Docker

With regard to...

### Orchestration

* No, Kubernetes has won

### Container runtime

* Often, but [`containerd`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is growing quickly

### Image build

* Yes
* Other image builders are still niche players (e.g. [`buildah`](https://github.com/containers/buildah), [`img`](https://github.com/genuinetools/img), [`kaniko`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko))
