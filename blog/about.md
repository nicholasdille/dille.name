After enduring DOS and GEM for some time, he developed an ever growing interest in the internals and the inner workings of computers and servers. All of this made him realize that the studies of Computer Science at the University of Bonn focusing on computer networks would be the next logical step.

For over twelve years now, Nicholas is concerned with virtualization and especially Server Based Computing and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. He is an DevOps Engineer at [Haufe-Lexware](https://www.haufe-lexware.com/), a digital media group based in Freiburg, Germany. Before that, he has been working as an IT architect - for [Makro Factory](http://www.makrofactory.com/) and [sepago](http://www.sepago.de/), both Microsoft and Citrix partners based in Karlsruhe and Cologne, Germany. His primary expertise is virtualization on all layers as well as SBC/VDI, cloud computing and configuration management in such environments. Nicholas has excelled in many large enterprise projects either by providing strategic market insights and by designing large scale environments.
