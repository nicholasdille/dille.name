After enduring DOS and GEM for some time, he developed an ever growing interest in the internals and the inner workings of computers and servers. All of this made him realize that the studies of Computer Science at the University of Bonn focusing on computer networks would be the next logical step.

Since 2002, Nicholas concerns himself in centralization, Server-Based Computing and thin clients and has been working as an IT architect since 2004 &#8211; currently for [Makro Factory](http://www.makrofactory.com/) and for [sepago](http://www.sepago.de/) before that. He focusses on all layers of virtualization as well as SBC, VDI, Cloud Computing and capacity management for such environments. Nicholas has supported many international enterprises in developing an IT strategy and creating technical designs.
