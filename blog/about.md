After enduring DOS and GEM for some time, he developed an ever growing interest in the internals and the inner workings of computers and servers. All of this made him realize that the studies of Computer Science at the University of Bonn focusing on computer networks would be the next logical step.

For over 20 years, Nicholas is concerned with automation as well as virtualization on all layers and is very passionate about containerization. Currently, he is a DevOps Engineer at [Haufe Group](https://www.haufegroup.com/), a digital media group based in Freiburg, Germany. In this role he maintains services for development teams covering all steps in the DevOps process. Before that, he has been working as an IT architect for end-user computing and infrastructure services - for [Makro Factory](http://www.makrofactory.com/) and [sepago](http://www.sepago.de/). Nicholas has excelled in many large enterprise projects by providing strategic market insights as well as by designing and implementing large scale environments.
